#PS1 - This variable controls how your command prompt looks in the terminal. It's like a template that defines the text you see each time the system is ready for you to type a command. By customizing the #PS1 variable, you can change the prompt to display information such as your username, your computer's name, the current folder you're in, or even add colors and special characters.
