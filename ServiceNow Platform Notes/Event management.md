It collects events from different sources, figures out what's causing the issues, and converts them into alerts. These alerts are then analyzed, grouped, and acted upon to resolve issues and maintain system health.

Event Management receives external events and generates alerts based on event and alert management rules. Events are sent directly to your instance via email server, script, SNMP trap, or web service API. The corresponding alerts appear on dashboards for tracking and remediation purposes.

As events occur on various systems, the [[MID Server connector instance]] sends them to the main instance. Event Management generates alerts, applies alert management rules, and prioritizes alerts for remediation and root cause analysis. This information can be viewed on dashboards, the alert list in Alert Intelligence, or from a service map.
