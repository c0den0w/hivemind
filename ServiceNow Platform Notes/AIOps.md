AIOps combines big data and machine learning to automate IT operations processes, including event correlation, anomaly detection and causality determination. (According to Gartner)

ServiceNow is a platform that has the data, and the ML engine to process the data perform correlation and log the issue, the track the remediation or resolution of issues. And the capability to have a agentic / orchestration workflow to automate the remediation.

The point of AIOps is the reduce the number of incidents by generating a proactive alert. This involves three stages, ingesting the data from various sources, pre-process the ingested data extract meaningful information. Process the data, analyze the historical trend, detect anomaly. Generate an alert. Correlate similar alerts for unified resolution. Automate the resolution

Key features of the ITOM AIOps use case include:
- Ingesting events and metrics through base-system integrations with chosen monitoring systems.
- Processing events and metrics to create alerts.
- Correlating alerts and conducting root cause analysis.
- Detecting anomalies within the system.
- Calculating the impact on application services.
- Utilizing the Service Operations workspace for operational management.
- Automating remediation actions based on alerts.
