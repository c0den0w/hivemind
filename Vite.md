Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced `/vit/`, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that provides [rich feature enhancements](https://vite.dev/guide/features) over [native ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), for example extremely fast [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vite.dev/guide/features#hot-module-replacement).
    
- A build command that bundles your code with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
